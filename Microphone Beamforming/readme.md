This notebook is a faithful reproduction of AN-1140, Application Note on Microphone arrays by TDK Invensense. Although the application note covers the basic ideas, advantages of different array configurations and directivity patterns, this notebook delves deeper and expands upon the governing equations that make such directivity patterns possible.

For simplicity, only 2-element microphone arrays are presented as they are sufficient to provide an overview of commonly used array configurations.
