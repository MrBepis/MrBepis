### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an acoustic engineer who is exploring ways in his free time to remember often overlooked concepts in signal processing.
This is a repository where I will start off by adding little tutorials on random but useful topics.

I am new to Git and version controlling, because this is a rather software developer centric domain. Perhaps I'll learn the ropes properly one day, in hopes that this will be a neat little tool to organize ideas.
